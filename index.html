            Hello! You have somehow found my rough draft of my portfolio! 
            My name is Kian Shirvan, and I am an aspiring web and software developer.
            I've always loved the challenge of logically approaching a puzzle to solve it,
            and that is exactly what web and software development is. One large puzzle,
            built up by many smaller pieces. That same approach should work for this portfolio, too!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pPicAlign">
            The idea behind this page is that it will serve as my actual portfolio.
            One day, I will have enough content hosted here to show off a variety of complex skills,
            and the projects I have completed using those skills. When that day comes, my portfolio
            will have transformed into an amateur showcase of basic CSS and HTML skills into something
            worthy of professional consideration.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pPicAlign">
            When the time comes, this site will be a huge piece of my resume that I send off to employers.
            I will include things about how I have been learning software development for over 3 years,
            how my entire life history has been largely based around the use of computers, how my approach to
            my work in computer science is not only productive but very effective and worthwile for any employer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Honestly, at this point I have kind of run out of things to talk about. However!
            I still want to add this last paragraph to demonstrate what happens in this container 
            when you continue to write below the picture. It is not the most elegant solution, as you can tell
            by the <i>slightly</i>, SLIGHTLY odd spacing. It takes a keen eye to notice, but I'm the kind of person who strives
            for perfection whenever I can and I know that, with time, I can make this page look MUCH better!
